## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to quantify and visualize the impact of Learning & Development programs on employee performance, engagement, and ROI.
It aims to transform L&D from a perceived cost center into a strategic investment that drives measurable business outcomes.

### Dataset Summary
- Total Records: 126,000
- Key Dimensions: Department, Role, ProgramName, DeliveryMode
- Key Metrics: Salary, TrainingHours, PerformanceGain, ROI, EngagementScore, InstructorRating

## 2. Business Problem
L&D departments often struggle to:
- Prove tangible ROI of training programs.
- Link training outcomes to employee performance improvement.
- Optimize budget allocation across departments and programs.

**Business Questions to Answer** :
1. Which departments and programs yield the highest ROI?
2. How does training effectiveness (PerformanceGain) vary by program, delivery mode, and difficulty?
3. Does employee engagement correlate with post-training performance?
4. Are we investing the L&D budget efficiently across roles and departments?
