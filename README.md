## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to quantify and visualize the impact of Learning & Development programs on employee performance, engagement, and ROI.
It aims to transform L&D from a perceived cost center into a strategic investment that drives measurable business outcomes.

### Dataset Summary
- Total Records: 126,000
- Key Dimensions: Department, Role, ProgramName, DeliveryMode
- Key Metrics: Salary, TrainingHours, PerformanceGain, ROI, EngagementScore, InstructorRating

## Business Problem
**L&D departments often struggle to:**
- Prove tangible ROI of training programs.
- Link training outcomes to employee performance improvement.
- Optimize budget allocation across departments and programs.

**Business Questions to Answer** :
1. Which departments and programs yield the highest ROI?
2. How does training effectiveness (PerformanceGain) vary by program, delivery mode, and difficulty?
3. Does employee engagement correlate with post-training performance?
4. Are we investing the L&D budget efficiently across roles and departments?

## Insights & Analysis
### Department-Level
- Departments like Finance and Operations show higher average ROI (>8%) with efficient budget utilization.
- Marketing and HR departments have lower ROI but higher engagement scores, suggesting need for targeted interventions.
### Program-Level
- Low difficulty programs with offline or hybrid delivery achieved better feedback scores (≥9) and higher PerformanceGain.
- Programs with InstructorRating >4.2 are strongly correlated with ROI improvement (r ≈ 0.7).
### Employee & Training Metrics
- Employees with >2 previous trainings show 15–20% higher post-training performance.
- Tenure <2 years employees benefit the most in PerformanceGain, reflecting value in onboarding training.
### ROI Trends
- Average ROI across all programs: ~6.5%
- Top-performing programs (e.g., Leadership 101, Advanced Finance) deliver >10% ROI.

## SWOT Analysis
| Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|------------|
|Strong data-driven structure for tracking L&D metrics.|ROI varies widely across departments.|
|High engagement and feedback scores indicate learner satisfaction.|Instructor quality inconsistency in certain programs.|
|Clear link between performance gain and ROI.|Limited time-series tracking of post-training performance.|

| Opportunities |	Threats |
|---------------|---------|
|Use predictive analytics to forecast ROI before rollout.|Budget cuts could impact training quality.|
|Standardize high-performing delivery modes and instructors.|High attrition may reduce long-term L&D ROI realization.|

## Conclusion & Recommendations
### Conclusion:
- Training programs positively impact employee performance and ROI.
- Departments with strategic budget planning and effective delivery modes outperform others.
- ROI can be maximized by focusing on program quality, delivery efficiency, and instructor impact.

### Recommendations:
- Prioritize high-ROI programs for expansion; phase out low-performing ones.
- Correlate engagement and performance metrics to design personalized training.
- Reinvest part of high ROI into continuous L&D innovation.
- Build predictive Power BI models to forecast training ROI.
- Use department-level dashboards for budget accountability and optimization.
